# Getting Started

## API keys

API keys are required for all HTTP requests to Pterodactyl. To do this, set the `Authorization` header to `Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>` (without the `<>`).

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>"
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
my_key = '<API_KEY>'

headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer %s' % my_key
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
const myKey = '<API_KEY>';

const headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    Accept: 'application/json',
    Authorization: `Bearer ${myKey}`
};
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Application API

An application API key can be generated by going to the "Application API" page in the administrator page, then pressing "Create New". Note that once you have created the key, the permissions cannot be modified.

### Client API

A client API key can be generated by going to "Account" > "API Credentials" then following the instructions to create a new key. Note that once this key is created, the full key will only be shown once. The identifier of the key will be shown in the overview afterwards where you can delete it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Exposing your API key can result in unwanted and dangerous actions happening on your Pterodactyl instance, make sure it is kept private.
{% endhint %}

## Additional Parameters

Some endpoints have the option to request additional information relating to the request via URL query parameters. This additional information is accessible through the `relationships` property of the response body (if applicable). Filtered and sorted parameters will be ordered from most to least relevance.

| Parameter Name | Description                                                                 | Example Usage                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| filter         | Filters the request by the type and value provided.                         | `?filter[email]=test@example.com` |
| include        | Related options that can be included in the request, separated with commas. | `?include=allocations,locations`  |
| page           | The page to fetch the data from (for paginated endpoints).                  | `?page=2`                         |
| per\_page      | The number of results to fetch from a paginated endpoint (default: 50).     | `?per_page=30`                    |
| sort           | The property/attribute to sort the response data by.                        | `?sort=uuid`                      |

## Ratelimits

The response headers from the API will always include `X-Ratelimit-Limit` and `X-Ratelimit-Remaining` which contain the number of requests that can be made to the API per-minute and the number of requests remaining in the minute timeframe respectively. The default API ratelimit is 240, but it can be changed in Pterodactyl environment file (`/var/www/pterodactyl/.env`).
